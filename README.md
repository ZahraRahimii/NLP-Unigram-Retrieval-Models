# NLP-Unigram-Retrieval-Models
This repo includes basic implementations of Unigram language modeling with smoothing, Document ranking using probabilistic retrieval, and Zipf’s law and cross-entropy evaluation

1. **Unigram Language Modeling**:

   * Tokenization and preprocessing
   * Unigram probability estimation
   * Evaluation using Zipf’s law and cross-entropy

2. **Probabilistic Information Retrieval**:

   * Ranking documents based on unigram probabilities (Jelinek-Mercer smoothing)
   * Evaluation of ranking effectiveness based on λ tuning and query types
